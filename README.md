# IPL-Data-Analysis
I have used the ipl data from the kaggle site. it had the match entries of the season from 2008- 2019. I have performed some EDA on the data and also used different machine learning algorithms to predict the match results.

The first file is the data analysis file. Here i have used data preprocessing types and performed some EDA
The second file is the match prediction file. Here I have prepared the data for fitting into the predictions models and performed accuracy score checks.
